    "research_type": "Animal Study",
    "short_summary": "37-day microgravity exposure in mice during the NASA Rodent Research-1 mission led to site-specific bone loss, particularly in weight-bearing regions of the femur. The study suggests that microgravity unloading might be the primary cause of this bone loss, with space radiation and other systemic stresses having minimal contribution."
